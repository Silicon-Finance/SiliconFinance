Silicon Finance's SiliconPad is the first decentralised IDO platform on BSC Network from Africa.

The silicon Finance native token SLK is a membership utility token. It will be used to grant holders access to IDO launchpad deal flow, information flow and specific presale rounds. Staking or holding SLK tokens will grant holders access to more restricted projects that are essentially “more interesting” or “more exclusive” SiliconPads goal is to minimise rug pulls, maximise security and primarily creating a better experience for DeFi enthusiasts.
